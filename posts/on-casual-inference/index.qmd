### Metrics

For clarity sake we're gonna rename:

- $True \ negatives \ = tn$
- $True \ positives \ = tp$
- $False \ positives \ = fp$
- $False \ negatives \ = fn$
 
#### Accuracy
$$
accuracy \ = \frac{tn + tp}{tn + tp + fp + fn}
$$

The accuracy

#### Type I error
$$
Type \ I \ error \ = \frac{fp}{fp + tn}
$$

When the model predict "1" on a ground truth of "0" this is identified as Type I error.
In our example predicting an "attrition" when the ground truth is "no attrition".  -->

# Motivation 

The *COVID-19 pandemic breakout* has led to a significant shift in the way we work, with many employees now working remotely or in a hybrid model. This has created a need for new tools and technologies to help businesses manage their office space more effectively.

This application for managing desk office booking is designed to address this challenge.

# How it works

Build on [Google apps script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) platform, the application is designed to work in a Google enviroment.

It allows: 

- Person quota managing over 2 weeks of booking
- Display names customization
- Bookings download

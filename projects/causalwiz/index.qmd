`causalwiz` is an R package for causal inference analysis. It provides tools for estimating treatment effects using various methods including Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW).

The package is accompanied by a series of <a href="../../posts.html" class="cool-link">articles</a>, *written in Italian*, covering theoretical foundations of causal inference and practical implementations of the methods implemented in `causalwiz`.

## Installation

You can install the package via Github repository:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("carminemnc/causalwiz")
```

## Usage

``` r
library(causalwiz)

# Load example data
data("welfare_small")

# Perform causal analysis
results <- ipw_estimators(
  data = welfare_small,
  estimation_method = "IPW",
  outcome = "y",
  treatment = "w",
  covariates = c("age", "polviews", "income", "educ", "marital", "sex")
)
```

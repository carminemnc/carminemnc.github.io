<p>The application uses a variety of NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis, word frequency analysis, word trends over time and aspect based sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>The Playground section of TripScraper is a sandbox where users can experiment with the NLP models that are used by the tool. This section allows users to try out different features of the models, to see how they work, and to learn more about how NLP can be used to analyze TripAdvisor reviews.</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>We made this application in order to manage people at office with the new rules for after Covid. This application has been made in 1 day and has to full fill quickly the need to manage easily time presence and booking for our Office.</p>
<p>This application is not designed to manage the full Office it is designed to have 1 version per team, floor, service etcâ€¦ For example we use one instance for our Paris Office and one for our Lyon Office.</p>
<p>With Office Desk Booking you can manageteam presence by assigning days to some teams and if there is remaining free place, each user can book a place.</p>
